## About

This project was created as part of the Flatiron School Software Engineering program. The application is a case management system for social workers serving Austin's LGBTQ population. 

## Basic Usage

##Organize by CRUD actions

From the main login page, social workers have the option to either login or create a new account.

Once logged in, case workers have access to the dashboard from which they have access to clients, client cases, community resources, and a list of all other social workers through drop down menus. 

## Index pages for social workers, clients, and resources
Here you can access a page with all social workers. If you click on their name, it will take you to their information page.

Here you can access a page with all clients. If you click on their name, it will take you to their information page.

Here you can access a page with all resources. If you click on a resource, it will take you to their information page.

## Show pages for social workers, clients, and resources
## Ability to edit
## Google maps API

The user can access show pages for social workers, clients, and resources. Social workers have the ability to create and update cases.

Each resource page contains a real location in Austin. The Google Maps API is utilized to display a map for the location on the resource show page. 


Here is a view page for all of a social worker's  clients. 

Here you can add a new client to the database.

Here you can view all open cases. Once a client case is closed, it will no longer show up on the cases page.
